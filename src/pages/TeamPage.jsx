Over the past three years I have transitioned from Education Coordinator to Director of Education and now Co-President. As drug overdoses continue to trouble our province, I think it is becoming extremely important to talk about drug misuse and the science behind how drugs interact with our bodies. I am really passionate about our unique \"student teaching students\" approach and I have seen first hand the impact it can make. My hope is that education will outweigh the social pressures our adolescence face and allow them to make informed decisions. My goal for this year is to reach new communities in YYC and engage more student volunteers.",

As Co-President, I share the responsibilities of overseeing the execution of the goals set out by our executive team. For me, RED has been an opportunity to exercise my interpersonal and scientific skills, through promotion of the club and directly presenting to Calgarians. Although the role of Co-President is a full-time position, I like to pursue my other interests. Being Mexican, futbol is a part of me and it’s need for athleticism and leadership has allowed me to pursue various endeavours. These endeavours include; Medical Assistant for the Canadian Armed Forces Reserves, and founding soccer and Spikeball organizations.",

I am passionate about our mission to foster a curiosity in science and facilitate an informed dialogue on the effects and consequences of drug use on the brain. I believe that a comprehensive perspective on the complexities of drug abuse is particularly relevant considering the opioid crisis devastating North America. As an Education Coordinator, my goal is to deliver meaningful presentations that resonate with our audience to encourage healthy and informed decision-making. I do this by helping to construct holistic and scientifically accurate presentations, as well as providing training for our presenters.

I am thrilled to have the opportunity to put my love for science to use while having a positive impact on young students. It is important that youth be able to make informed decisions about substance use, and I believe that RED’s fact-based approach can be a valuable tool in their education. I look forward to delivering accurate and useful educational material to students, and hope to promote their own curiosity about science while doing so.

As a biomedical sciences student, RED presented the perfect opportunity to unite my academic interests with my passion for advocacy. During my time with RED, I had my first real exposure to teaching in a classroom environment. It was inspiring to see students genuinely engaging with the real-world implications of contentious issues like addiction and the opioid crisis. Last year, we were able to reach over 1000 students at 13 different schools. This year, as VP External, my goals are to see RED expand its presence in Calgary to even more schools, and to lay the groundwork for our expansion to other parts of Alberta.",

Over the years, their habits progressed and drugs became a part of their lifestyle. Witnessing first-hand the impact that substance abuse has on youth has driven me to take a stand and educate a younger audience. My goal and purpose on this team is to make sure that the next generation of students get the opportunity to learn about substance abuse in a way that was not made available to me or my peers. Through engaging presentations and interactive learning, I hope to inform the younger generation about the science, and knowledge of drugs and substances. I would also like to introduce the world of science to youth at a younger age as it is one of the fastest-growing and innovative industries.",

It has the capacity to learn, understand and apply. Although today we are still unable to know how the whole brain functions, we have discovered many intresting properties of the brain. At the moment recreational drugs is one of the simplest concepts to learn yet very interesting. It is fascinating to know how the body reacts to these reagents and how we become addicted. In this club I will be ensuring the smooth operation of IT. I hope with this information we can educate teens, so they can make informed decisions.",

In this area of study, objective understanding of the potential consequences of my actions are vital in making well-informed decisions. However, it is not a requirement to be a critical thinker to make well-informed decisions. Speaking from experience, understanding the foundational basics can largely assist in mitigating several consequences and misunderstandings. I hope this will enable youths to take that first, possibly intimidating, step in trying to understand complex topics - such as the effects of drugs. Through my involvement in RED, I also hope to reflect the team’s passionate efforts in this endeavor, in person and on the website. I also enjoy a good pun and when I have free time, I love to spend it with good company!",

Along with the academic introductions to the field has come the lesson that such empowering and practically-relevant knowledge should ultimately be disseminated to all – especially the youth – to enable them to make well-informed decisions. Hence, I was prompted to join RED; I hope to support the team’s mission of providing all with easier access to pragmatic neuroscience-based knowledge, such as that pertaining to the effects, functioning and regulation of drugs, through various exciting educational mediums. Further, I hope to facilitate the club’s endeavours, with the rest of the IT team, by helping to overcome all technical challenges, and by ultimately assisting the expansion of its opportunities, and positive influence.",
